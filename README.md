# Crave Audition

This is a simple React app that will return the correct amount of change to a user in Crave Currency denominations. 

## Possible edge cases:

If the user inputs their change in cents (i.e 12.34) the input will automatically round the number to the nearest whole number.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
